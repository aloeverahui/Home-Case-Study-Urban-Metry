This may be due to several factors for example desirable location, quality of the building, higher demand and lower supply of units. From this data, we might assume that Harbourview could be a choice for investment. Although the year of completion of this building was year of 1994, the trend of selling price is significantly increasing.\n2. From the data shown, Lily Point has the highest number of demand. This could be due to the price which is more affordable to buyers. However, it has a declining trend in selling price. Rainbow Apartment has a fluctuating trend in term of selling price. The significant decline and rebound of price might due to several factors. The building condition could be a reason that led to reduce prices since it was built in year 1987.\n3. We can clearly see that the Harbourview and Rainbow Apartment have higher median valuation price compared to Lily Point. However, the fluctuations in prices and inconsistency of sales may indicate market volatility. Lily Point is generally having more consistent of sales and stable median valuation price. This might be a more\nfavourable and afforable property among buyers of middle range income. ",

We can infer that the Average Sales Price (psf) for each neighborhood experienced a notable decrease at the beginning of 2018.\n3.
